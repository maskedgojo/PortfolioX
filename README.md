## 🖥️ About the Project: Team Portfolio Website

This website is our collective digital canvas – a space where we proudly present our individual talents, collaborative projects, and shared journey. Inspired by our diverse backgrounds and interests, the portfolio brings everything together with a touch of fun and nostalgia.

### 🎨 Why an 8-bit Retro Gaming Theme?

We chose the **8-bit retro gaming aesthetic** to reflect our shared love for creativity, storytelling, and nostalgia. It captures the essence of our journey – playful, pixelated, and full of character. Just like old-school games, our portfolio aims to entertain, inform, and inspire. The pixel-art visuals and animations add a fun twist to an otherwise professional site, making our story as engaging as our skills.
